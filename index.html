						<h2>Digital Image Project</h2>
						<p>For this project we were to create a banner using provided images to highlight parenting. We were also required to
							create an icon/logo using the provided images.</p>
						<p>For the banner background I chose an agrarian theme to represent the family economy. For the two foreground overlapping
							images I chose the gentleman w/ the little girl on his shoulders, and the little boy that is chewing on a toy. I also
							used the same little boy chewing on this toy for the icon/logo image.</p>
						<p>
							My final image is a <i>"Then & Now"</i> mash-up.  I took an early 1900's picture and combined it with a modern day
							picture.

				<h2>Digital Audio Project</h2>
				<p>For this project we were to create a digital audio file with the purpose of illustrating that we understand how to capture
					and manipulate digital audio and prepare it for playback on the web in an MP3 file format.</p>
				<p>Music has always played an important part in my life, therefore, I decided to do a short tribute to the Delta Blues music
					genre. For the background music I used Audacity to record myself playing guitar; for this I used my computer and built-in
					microphone. Once I had the background track laid down I recorded another track with just my spoken voice.</p>
				<p>Lastly, I used Audacity to combine both tracks, and used the envelope feature to fade in / fade out the background music
					during the portion where I was talking. This was a very exciting project for me; I had never used Audacity before this,
					and never realized a free program had such endless possibilities when it came to digital audio. I will definitely be
					using what I learned during this project in the future.</p>

				<h2>Digital Video Project</h2>
				<p>For this project we were to create a digital video with the purpose of illustrating that we understand how to capture
					and manipulate digital video and prepare it for playback on the web in either .WMV or .MP4 format.</p>
				<p>I decided to do a short video about relic hunting with a metal detector. Relic hunting is where you research past history
					and try to determine where people once lived or gathered. Once you determine a location you then use a metal detector
					to locate lost historic items such as coins, buttons, buckles, etc.</p>
				<p>To capture the video I used my Android HTC Evo 3D smartphone. When I first started this project I was having a lot of
					trouble getting stable video; I was trying to hold the camera with my hands while filming and walking – this method
					produced very unstable shaky video. As such, some of my esteemed classmates suggested using a tripod to help stabilize
					the video. I did not have a tripod, however, I was able to make one using dirt and some tree branches. Stabilizing the
					camera with the homemade tripod instantly resolved the shaky video issues.</p>
				<p>Next, once I had captured sufficient video I then chose a nice acoustic melody to use as the background music throughout
					the video compilation.</p>
				<p>Lastly, I used Windows Movie Maker to create and manipulate the entire video process. I will say, for a free program,
					Movie Maker has a lot to offer – there are numerous built-in effects, and transitions to choose from, in addition to
					basic audio track editing. I will most certainly be using it again for future projects.</p>
